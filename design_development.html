People seeking answers post one question and get matched with people who have relevant experience that might help them answer this question. What makes it a reliable, authentic experience is the video component. People have profile videos rather than a profile picture or something else, and the act of matching people is to lead to a video chat so that the question and answer part can be a conversation rather than a post to a forum.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><center><div id="owl-demo" class="owl-carousel owl-theme"><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/1_signup.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/2_signup_info.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/3_signup_info2.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/4_video_prompt.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/5_record_video.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/6_Q_A_1.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/7_ask_question_1.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/8_answer_page1.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/9_profile_video.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/10_experience2.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/11_sifting_info1.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/12_match_ping.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/13_complete_profile1.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/14_rate_2.jpg"></div><div class="item"><img src="images/paper_prototype/15_report_2.jpg"></div></div></center><p>People sign up for the app with their username and email credentials and then go through the process of filling out their profile information.</p><p>First, they fill out what topics they know a lot about and then things they would like to know more about. We originally had this be an ‘Experience’ and ‘Interests’ section, but we found that it was not clear to our users what information to put in these sections and why. Asking for things they know about and things they want to know more about, we found through co-design, was much more self-explanatory in both of these ways.</p><p>The next thing they do is make a profile video. Now, this is a bit of a novel idea to many people, so we plan to give them a couple of example videos so they know what sort of things to say in the video. The video will be up to 30 seconds in length. We think this is plenty of time to give a summary of your experience and interests as well as giving people a good sense of you, your personality, etc. Next, our user would fill out the ‘Experience’ and ‘Interests’ sections that we originally had. We will reframe the sections to be more specific so they are not confused as to what things they should put in each section. We think that while this is a somewhat arduous task for our users, without this information in their profiles, they will not have as great of an experience with Maven. For example, without some specifics of their background, people may not choose you to answer their questions. This information would theoretically assist whatever algorithm is recommending people to each other.</p><p>The next step is to decide if you want to ask a question or answer questions. Now, if the user decides to ask a question, they can pose the question and answer questions while they are waiting to video chat with people. We feel that it is important not to put our users into boxes of who is answering questions and who is asking them. Certainly some people will do more of one than the other, but we don’t want to cut that functionality for anyone. The way we have made this concept as clear and not-confusing as possible is to separate the actions out. If you want to ask a question, you go to the asking page, alternatively if you want to answer a question, you go to the answering page. But in every interaction that you have with someone on the sight, there is an asker and an answerer. No interaction happens without a question, and no interaction happens with two people asking questions. In this way, the question becomes the clear reason why you are talking to this person, and the interaction need not go beyond that if that is where the users feel that relationship should naturally end.</p><p>Once you have asked a question, you will be able to go through the act of sifting through potential answerers you’d like to talk to. You press the search button, and you go through the queue of people the algorithm has recommended for you. You watch these peoples’ videos (which will be automatically played upon arriving to their page), maybe read some of their profile information, and then decide whether or not you want to talk to them by clicking the X or the check. You will also be able to see whether or not the person is within about an hour driving distance from you, indicated by a Google Maps pinpoint in the top right corner of their page. Across the board, our users wanted some way to know if the person was geographically close to them since that would be important to know if you want to take the interaction offline and get coffee or something. You could keep going through the queue until you think you’ve seen enough people that you like, or just come back to it later. To leave the queue you just press the home button in the top left corner.</p><p>When you decide to answer questions, the process of filtering people is very similar with just a few small changes. First, when you are looking someone’s page, you will see the question they posed as well as their video and all the other information. Then, the process of deciding who you want to talk to will depend also on whether or not the question is one you can and want to help with.</p><p>Once you have said yes to someone and they have said yes to you, you get a message in your inbox saying you have a match and that person will show up now on your question page or answer page depending on whether you posed the question or they did. Then, you can go to their profile and request a time to meet. You will fill out a table of times that are good for you (a.k.a WhenIsGood) and they will get a request in their inbox to see if one of those times work. Once a time is found, you can export the time to your calendar if you want. Otherwise, the app will give you a notification when you are coming up on the time to chat, and you can use the mobile or web interface, press the chat button and it will start a google hangout with the other person.</p><p>After the hangout, there will be a rating system where you will be able to give the person a gold star if the conversation went really well and the answer to the question was satisfactory. We don’t have a system of rewarding askers, but in both cases, you will be able to report the other person if you want to. The gold stars will show up as badges on the person’s profile for certain milestones, i.e. 10, 25, 50 gold stars.</p><p>When you want to change your question, you just X out the question that is there already and type a new one. The people who matched with you from the previous question will disappear and you will go through the sifting process again.</p><h3>How well does it meet user needs? In what ways does it fall short?</h3><p>Maven meets the need for users to feel an authentic connection with other people and guides the conversation to be more than aimless ‘chitter chatter’. The interface promotes authentic relationships, because it matches users with other users that share similar interests and professional aspirations. Each person on the website will immediately be able to build what Emile Durkheim defines as Mechanical and Organic Solidarity. This means that people will be able to connect based on the many similarities they share, but our interface will also connect people who have complementary differences, so that they can build an interdependent relationship. The differences will matched such that what one user wants to learn, their match will want to teach and visa versa.</p><p>Where the interface falls short is in its usability. The interface seems to be more confusing to users like Vicky, who are between 45-60 years old. Younger users have a shorter learning curve, because of their experience using the various smartphone apps that served as Maven’s design inspiration. This not only makes the interaction more confusing for older users, but also makes them more vague on why they are giving out certain information, such as their experience or interests. In addition to being unclear about why they are listing their experience, the value added to Mavens is less tangible, because the Mavens are sharing their knowledge in more of any altruistic format.</p><center><img src="images/design_development/user_feedback.jpg"></center><h3>What important alternative designs did you consider, either initially or during the refinement of this idea? Why did you reject them/prefer the one you chose?</h3><h4>Visualizer</h4><center><img src="images/design_development/visualizer.jpg"></center><p>Our project initiated with the idea of making an app that would help users visualize their useful LinkedIn connections. It was this idea that we had throughout Phase 1 and going into Phase 2. The goal of the app was to take the existing wealth of data on LinkedIn and present it in a way that made it much easier to interact with. We would allow users to set goals for themselves in terms of location, company, career field, etc. and the app would then generate a visual for the paths they could take through their connections.</p><h4>Live Connection</h4><center><img src="images/design_development/live_connections.jpg"></center><p>One of the ideas that surfaced at our ideation session at the start of phase 2 was the idea of an app that would match you with people at events you attended. The goal was to help you recognize opportunities and make connections that could help expand your network towards your career goals. We had a lot of different ideas for the specifics of the app, but the overall concept was to connect people at events or locations based on their career/networking goals.</p><h4>Why Not</h4><p>The image above shows the decision matrix that we used to pinpoint which of our initial 3 ideas we wanted to move forward with. The areas we felt important to consider when settling on our final design were interesting interface opportunity, impact, scope, and the balance of authenticity and goals.</p><h4>Interesting Interface Opportunity</h4><p>Because HFID is centered around designing an interface we felt it was important to select a project that would allow us to really explore and play around with interface elements. This category is a combination of what seems the most fun (from our perspective) and what we felt would be engaging learning material for the course. The Visualizer was a clear winner to us as it hinged around making data into an interesting visualization. This project would’ve been all about the look and would’ve allowed us to be very artistic and creative. We ranked Mentor Mash as second, because it had a lot of room in the idea for pushing our interface to be more interesting to us. The Live Connection came as last, because we felt there was less wiggle-room in the interface. We would want to keep it simple to put the focus on the live interactions.</p><h4>Impact</h4><p>Our second criteria was impact, to ensure that we were working on something we felt could widely affect the world of networking as we know it. Our final idea, Mentor Mash, excelled in this area. We felt that by directly connecting mentors and mentees we would have the most impact on users. We would be helping them develop/foster really important long-term relationships. Live Connection came in second, because it also centered around getting people face to face and directly impacting users through expanding their network in a way to help them reach their goals. We all agreed that the Visualizer would be least impactful, because all that was being done on our end was presenting useful information in a helpful way. We would not be engaging with the user in a direct enough way to help them grow their network and achieve their goals.</p><h4>Scope</h4><p>Scope was incredibly important for us to consider as well. We didn’t want to move forward with an idea only to find that we’d either bitten off more than we could chew or had an app that was so small it gave us no room for growth. Again our final idea was widely agreed upon as the best in a category. Mentor Mash offered an app that had multiple screens and a lot of flexibility in the amount of offered functionality. The Visualizer came in second for having a much more limited scope. Our concern with the visualizer was that it basically hinges on only one screen and may not have much room for growth. We viewed it as a little too simplistic for the scope of this class. Live Connection came in last again , because we felt the scope was a little too large. This app had a more complex interaction that we felt would be hard to fully investigate given the time and resources from this course.</p><h4>Balance of Authenticity and Goals</h4><p>One of the things we realized through our conversations with users in phase 1 was that there is a very important and delicate balance between being authentic in networking interactions and being goal oriented. Users expressed concern that their interactions may seem ingenuine or forced if they began an interaction with someone who they were expressly meeting with to get closer to a job opportunity. We found this to be at the core of the problem that users did not enjoy networking and found it to feel “canned” or like “chitter-chatter”. Our final winner, Mentor Mash was determined to be the best in regards to balancing authenticity and goals. Because we framed the app as a way to connect with mentors we made the relationship less goal specific and more authentic. Interactions with others on Mentor Mash could still easily lead to job opportunities and valuable resources, but they were framed as being about the connection and not as much about the goal. The Live Connection was seen as the next best in this category. We felt that because it encouraged users to just get to know valuable people and develop relationships through face to face interactions at events they were already attending, those interactions would feel more authentic. It still was more goal-oriented than the Mentor Mash idea so we worried that those interactions could still feel inauthentic to those being approached. The Visualizer came in last, because it is almost complete goal oriented . The Visualizer treats people as steps that can be taken for one to approach their goals. It does nothing to foster those connections and interactions so we would have been uninvolved in providing authenticity to those connections.</p><h4>Initial Refinement of Idea</h4><p>Once Mentor Mash was our selected idea we started to flesh out and dive into the specifics of how the app will work. While initially refining our idea we had some conversations with our professors, Lynn and Amon, that greatly affected our initial designs and prototypes. Our biggest transition was from the idea of connecting users to mentors to the idea of focusing on a question and answer format. Lynn cited her experiences in mentorship stating that most often those connections came from existing relationships or were fostered out of initial connections based around someone seeking advice. We also realized through that conversation that paring people up in a mentor-mentee format could be very intimidating. It seemed like a large amount of commitment to have right off the bat.</p><p>From this insight we transitioned over from Mentor Mash to our initial design for Maven. This new idea centered around users being able to both pose life questions and answer the questions of others. We decided to focus on that initial connection and put the power/choice of fostering those relationships more into the hands of the user. We also made the decision to avoid using the word mentor as we didn’t want to imply a required level of commitment to these interactions and to the mavens that users end up connecting to.</p><center><img src="images/paper_prototype/sammy_interaction_flow.jpg"></center><center><img src="images/paper_prototype/vicky_interaction_flow.jpg"></center><h3>What key insights did you gain in trying to produce a design that addresses your brief?</h3><h4>Recognize the breadth of experience that people come in with.</h4><p>Different users have different mindsets, and it is very important to consider the tester’s background before engaging in a user test. The unique experiences that each person have may trigger or cause success or difficulty in interacting with a feature you design. For example, the connotation of networking stands for slow connections with a person at a time for the Vickys, but it may mean mass outreach for our Talus. Likewise, a Tindr-like interaction is not something that everyone understands, and this creates an interesting dynamic between people who had that background and exposure to the swiping experience and those who completely miss the concept.</p><h4>Not everything has to explain itself.</h4><p>We found that with our design, understanding the app before you use it is very important. We thought that the entire concept of the design had to be self-explanatory through the interface, but we realized that and in-depth introduction to the idea as a whole really helped our users understand everything they were doing with the interface.</p><h4>Paper prototyping is useful to a point.</h4><p>For us, paper prototyping couldn’t really accurately go through every interaction of our interface. Specifically, our idea is very video-centric and so we had to go into the domain of “people-prototyping” by acting out videos. And for things we felt could not fully be represented through people or paper prototyping, we will keep in mind to test thoroughly as we develop our design on a screen.</p><h4>Be flexible.</h4><p>Although we went into our user tests with a plan and a preconceived notion of how the paper testing should go, we sometimes found that it was best to allow users to direct the conversation and the testing process. One user did not want to engage with the paper prototype as much as we intended them to, but by allowing them to explore the prototype in an open-ended way and direct the conversation surrounding the idea of our app we gained many valuable insights. We also interacted with one user who was really stressed by how confusing they found the act of paper prototyping and we found that in that case it was best to back off on the process of running through tasks and reevaluate how to make the user feel most comfortable. Our takeaway was that each user you test with will be unique and the way to get the most value out of those interactions is to be flexible with how they are formatted and open to adjustments that positively affect the experience for the user.</p><center><img src="images/design_development/insights.jpg"></center></div></body></html>
