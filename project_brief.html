The interface on LinkedIn makes it difficult to see their network's information. This project will raise the bar of social sites to improve the relationships between their users rather than simply archiving the connections. We will transform LinkedIn information into data visualizations that afford users the ability to identify commonalities or interests shared by many of their connections.  Our data visualizations help users identify opportunities for personal growth, which they can do with people already in their network.</p><center><img src="images/initAppSketch.png"></center><p>This design allows users to visualize existing paths to their goals through their pre-existing connections on LinkedIn, addressing the core problem that users are currently unaware of the extent of their network paths and how to use those paths to meet specific career goals.</p><p>To make collecting information and feedback from users an efficient and enjoyable experience, we have prepared some initial thoughts for what we want to ask our users:</p><ul><li>How do you currently discover opportunities and other companies? What are the steps that you take to create your network and find new areas to move toward?</li><li>How do you currently use LinkedIn?</li><li>What are some of the current challenges that you face when networking? What are some challenges you face when using LinkedIn?</li><li>What are your goals when networking?</li></ul><p>Of course, the information we want from our users varies considerably depending on the stage of our development. Therefore, we also have a tentative process for how we want to engage with our users. First, we'd like to collect information through interviews and observation. We will not only ask our users relevant questions for the time frame, but we'll also try to do what they do ourselves and reflect on our process. Later on, as we produce more polished prototypes, we will again meet with our users shortly to gauge their reactions to our designs and reposition our development in an iterative fashion. People who may be good candidates for us to reach out to include: professional planners at major universities who are power users for LinkedIn, students from colleges looking for internships and jobs, young and elderly professionals, and even startups such as Proximate who are working on making networking easier in the future.</p><p>To meet everyone's learning goals, we will meet consistently in and out of the classroom. We will have open communication among members about how the project is going and we will regularly revisit the team contract to make sure all of our team goals and individual goals are being met.</p></div></body></html>
