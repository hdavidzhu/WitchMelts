    h3 LinkedIn - John

    p LinkedIn is a social media platform with the goal of affording users the ability to network online. This includes maintaining connections with people who they have met in person and reaching out to new people in a chosen industry. The data on LinkedIn provides potential to gain useful insights about an individual's network. Since the data has been vetted by LinkedIn, it is very relevant to networking. We will utilize LinkedIn to inform us about what is important to networking, but will create a better way to absorb this data from a user’s perspective.

    p The above screenshot shows LinkedIn’s interface to comb through the data held by LinkedIn. It is possible to put in several different search criteria on the left hand side of the page. We could use the similar search criteria in our project, but create a more user friendly display of the people found by that search, through data visualization.
    h3 Proximate - Chelsea

    p Proximate is ideologically similar to what our app is trying to do. The goal of their site is to create visualizations of your network based on the people you met and connected with at an event. We can draw inspiration from their method of visualization. They have lines that represent the connections between people at the event and allow you to highlight a specific node to see those connections in particular. The UI itself is quite messy and does not provide any details beyond a name and face.
    p We could draw inspiration from this visual, but make the personal information of the people one is connected to more easily accessible and organize the connections in a cleaner format so that it is easier to read/interpret output.

    p This second screenshot shows the bigger picture of Proximate. They have a name-based search functionality which we could expand to do searches based on careers/skills instead of finding one specific connection. As opposed to their main visualization, the left panel is very clear and neat. We could implement a similar design to easily convey the options users have when exploring our site.
    h3 InMaps - David
    p You may consider InMaps as the last iteration of our idea brought together by the team at LinkedIn. InMaps “provides a visual representation of your professional LinkedIn universe. This appealing visualization tool allows anyone with a Linkedin account to map their professional ties and is a great way to understand the relationship patterns between you and your entire set of LinkedIn connections.” However, this project did not seem to be successful, as the company discontinued the visualization tool at the beginning of this very month. InMaps decorates each of your connections as a node and bridges nodes together based on how well the people you know connection. In effect, this produces a gigantic web that also reveals how your network clusters. InMaps is relevant to our project because we share the similar goals of making user networks more useful for professionals. LinkedIn has a rich collection of information, but people as we’ve noticed so far rarely could take advantage of the full potential. The “webbing creation” is what we wanted to go with before doing more of this research; as we see following, this generates a tremendous amount of clutter and dense groupings. We like how color separates groups from one another, demonstrating how clusters can be visualized in a bigger picture. One thing that InMaps primarily lacked was the ability to reveal opportunities, and this may be the key factor that separates this novel toy-like projection from being a real value booster for the professionals.

    p The first insight I’ve gained was from the way names were labelled. If you look, the names are actually not labelled, and you have to hover over them to know what contacts you are looking at. This greatly reduces clutter on the page, but it may be confusing for people who don’t see any people on the screen. If you hover your mouse over the cluster, the name does pop up, but no additional information is displayed. Another insight is that the user is placed at the center of the page, and the whole network is visualized in one map. There is no ability to zoom in and see individual areas, so you have to see the map as an comprehensive entity with you as the center.
    p It may make sense that this is the first step to take when creating a new visualization tool. By focusing on what LinkedIn thought was important, their developers were able to reveal the clusters that surround a person’s professional life. This gives us a sense of what groups of people I should try to expand, or which area of my network should I work to strengthen. I think what we can take away from LinkedIn’s attempt is to start simple and work in a useful direction. Stay away from the arcane and the confusing; it may be because of the clusters and the lack of good labels that users did not find good value in the visualizer. InMaps also tells us that we should clearly define who our users are and what they are trying to accomplish to fit a mapping better to their needs.

    h3 Amazon - Claire
    p We chose to look closely at Amazon because Amazon has a rather seamless search and filter experience. In our product we need to allow users to search and filter results to tailor to their personal goals in a way that is intuitive and not overwhelming.
    p Because of the enormity of Amazon’s catalogue, it is imperative to their user experience that their search and filter functionality be seamless. And I would say that for the most part, it is. I demonstrated this by searching for a shower head. When I first search for a shower head, there are 13,102 results. This might seem overwhelming, but really isn’t to the user because the top results are strategically (and algorithmically) chosen to be the ones most popular and highest rated. These results alone are what the average user is looking for.

        img(src='images/amazon1.png')
    p My main concern looking at the way Amazon handles filters is they are designing for edge cases. There is a lot of pretty extraneous filtering functionality that is extremely specific to whatever you search for, in this case shower heads. While this might be helpful, and seem really useful, the average user is going to look at just the first few things that pop up on the screen since they are filtered to show top rated products that are relevant to the search.

        img(src='images/amazon2.jpg')
    p Upon further reflection, however, I came to the conclusion that while these specific filters may not be relevant to the average user, Amazon has designed the page in such a way, that this is not at all a hinderance to the average user. The main focus of the page are the top results and what most users will care the most about.
    p Also, when you look closely at the order of filters, they go from top to bottom what is probably most valuable to an average user to what is probably least valuable to the average user. The average user probably cares most about price, general categories of the product, and reviews, which are 3 of the first things you can filter by. Toward the bottom we get filters like who the seller is, packaging options, and how recently the item was stocked, things the average user probably doesn’t care about.
    p Overall, I think we can take away a lot of this style of search and filter for our own product. Specifically the way Amazon has made their filtering very customizable but it is still usable and does not get in the way of the most important part of the searching, which are the results.
